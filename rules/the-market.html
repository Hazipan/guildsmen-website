      <h1>The Market</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Market! Here we outline how buying equipment works and some common place items that you would
        generally find in shopping areas. Shop till you drop!</p>

      <section id="buying-items">
        <h2>Buying Items</h2>
        <p>Knowing what you can and cannot buy is easy. If it is within your wealth category, you can buy those items in
          some abundance. If it is one wealthy category above yours, you can buy those items sparingly. If it is below
          your wealth category, you can buy those items in great abundance.</p>

        <p>What items are in what wealth category is entirely up to Game Master discretion. If the Game Master doesn't
          think your character should be able to buy the item, then your character cannot buy the item. The Game Master
          can also put items in the Exquisite+ category, which is one category above Exquisite.</p>

        <p>If you come to a situation where a specific item would be useful, maybe your character would reasonably have
          the item. If you can argue that they would reasonably have the item, and the Game Master agrees with your
          argument, then you would have the item.</p>

        <p>When it comes to buying weapons, its best to assume that they would fall under the Wealthy category and
          certain others (such as guns) would fall under the Exquisite category. Remember that all weapons either have a
          damage bonus of +1 or +2 (light weapons get +1 and heavy weapons get +2), except for bows and guns (see the
          <a href="/rules/combat.html#weapons"><em>Combat chapter</em></a>).
        </p>

        <p>The following is a guide to useful and mentioned items where the wealth category they fall into may not be
          inherently understood, as well as items that require special description, or items that may not be thought of
          to exist. Anything not on this list is decided on-the-fly, during play whether or not the item exists and what
          wealth category it would fall into.</p>

      <section id="consumables">
        <h2>Consumables</h2>
        <p>Consumables are items that a character can consume and gain an effect. Some harm, other heal. Some do a bit
          of both.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="description">Causes all stats to drop to -1 for 1d6 hours on consumption. The more often this is

          without poisoning yourself. Can be resisted with a Tough check of 10 or more. Resisted only prevents Harm from
          being taken that round. The poison will still be ongoing.</p>
