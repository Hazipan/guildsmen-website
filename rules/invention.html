        <h1>Invention</h1>
        <p>Invention is how complex machines and devices are designed. Everything from light bulbs, to guns, to
            impressive architecture, to cannons, to flying vehicles and ground vehicles; all of these are designed
            through invention. </p>

        <h2>The Power of Invention</h2>
        <p>Invention is a multi-step process. First, you’ll design the item you wish to make, then you’ll need to gather
            the resources and manpower to create the item, and finally, you’ll actually create the item – first with a
            prototype then onward to a fully functioning version.</p>

        <p>Designing an item takes a simple <em>invent</em> skill check. This skill check will vary in difficulty based
            on how futuristic the invention is as well as how complex the invention is. You will then add a blueprint to
            your gear. You cannot attempt to make the item without that blueprint. If this blueprint is lost, you must
            remake the design and someone else may make your design.</p>

        <p>After the design has been made, you must gather the proper resources and manpower to create the invention.
            This will vary greatly depending on the thing you’re creating and will generally require a fair amount of
            wealth and role play.</p>

        <p>Once you’ve gathered all of this, you’ll need to craft a prototype. The difficulty to create the item will
            require you to make multiple crafting skill checks in order to create a successful prototype. If you fail
            any of these skill checks, then your prototype fails, and you must restart the invention process, but you’ll
            get to roll with advantage to create the new blueprint.</p>

        <p class="tableTitle">Skill Checks Needed</p>
        <div class="table2Col">
            <div class="colL">
                <p>Very Easy</p>
                <p>Easy</p>
                <p>Average</p>
                <p>Difficult</p>
                <p>Very Difficult</p>
            </div>
            <div class="colS">
                <p>1</p>
                <p>2</p>
                <p>3</p>
                <p>4</p>
                <p>5</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>You may also pay a craftsman to build your prototype for you if you want, but this will cause your wealth to
            go down and you must be at least at the Wealthy category.</p>

        <p>Once you have a working prototype, you can then craft a fully functioning version, either by paying people to
            create it or by one standard craft skill check with all the necessary materials and equipment.</p>

        <p>If you want to upgrade your invention, you will need to redo the invention process. However, you will have
            advantage on all dice rolls since you already have a similar device to work with.</p>

        <p>If you want to reverse engineer an item, you will have to do the same process, just backwards.</p>

        <h2>Navidus Crystals</h2>
        <p>Navidus Crystals are a powerful material that are only found inside of Mythical creatures. They are naturally
            occurring power sources with a lot of potential. They are used to power trains, elevators, Mechs, and other
            complex devices. However, they are also very dangerous.</p>

        <p>If a Crystal cracks or breaks in any way, the energy stored inside the Crystal will release explosively. This
            causes Harm equal to 3 times the size of the Crystal in a radius also equal to 3 times the size of the
            Crystal measured in feet. So, a crystal of 3 inches could explode to deal 9 Harm to everything within 9 feet
            if damaged.</p>

        <p>Since Navidus Crystals are used to power complex devices, whenever you invent something that requires a
            source of power (such as a light bulb, a motor, etc.) you must use a Navidus Crystal in the design. This
            will allow the device to be powered but will also give it an important weakness. Any device powered by
            Navidus energy has a potential to explode violently, making the invention of complex and futuristic
            technology dangerous if handled poorly.</p>

        <p>Navidus Crystals only hold so much energy. When powering a device, all the crystals used will need to be
            replaced every 3 in-game days when the device is regularly used. Also, the larger a device is or the more
            work the device is able to perform, the larger the crystal powering it needs to be.</p>

        <p class="tableTitle">Device Size to Crystal Size</p>
        <div class="table2Col">
            <div class="colL">
                <p>Tiny</p>
                <p>Very Small</p>
                <p>Small</p>
                <p>Medium</p>
                <p>Large</p>
                <p>Very Large</p>
            </div>
            <div class="colS">

        </div>

        <p>For exact dimensions for sizes, see the table for Mech stats lower down.</p>

        <p>Since Navidus Crystals can be hunted down by anyone with the resources to kill a Mythic, black market devices
            are common, making a wide variety of odd and dangerous devices available to those that have the right
            connections.</p>

        <p>Navidus Crystals crack and break as easily as hollow glass orbs and are fully charged when first harvested
            from a Mythic.</p>

        <h2>Mechs</h2>
        <p>Mechs are semi-autonomous metal creations that serve singular purposes and are designed to automate very
            specific tasks so regular people don’t have to do them. They are used as civil protectors, to perform
            extreme labor, or to serve their creators in whatever way they deem necessary.</p>

        <p>Mechs are designed for any purpose their creator wishes and are generally designed with the form of a living
            creature in mind. Mechs can created by anyone through the invention process as long as they have the right
            resources.</p>

        <p>After you design your Mech, you will need to determine its stats. A Mech’s stats are based off of the
            material used to create it, the size of it, and how it’s powered.</p>

        <p>The size of the Mech will help determine your mechs physical stats.</p>

        <div class="mechStats">
            <p>Class</p>
            <p class="mid">Size</p>
            <p class="mid">Tough</p>
            <p class="mid">Nimble</p>
            <p class="mid">Harm</p>

            <p class="start">Very Small</p>
            <p class="mid">4"-1'</p>
            <p class="mid">+0</p>
            <p class="mid">+5</p>
            <p class="end">5</p>

            <p class="start">Small</p>
            <p class="mid">1'-3'</p>
            <p class="mid">+5</p>
            <p class="mid">+3</p>
            <p class="end">10</p>

            <p class="start">Medium</p>
            <p class="mid">3'-7'</p>
            <p class="mid">+10</p>
            <p class="mid">+1</p>
            <p class="end">15</p>

            <p class="start">Large</p>
            <p class="mid">7'-12'</p>
            <p class="mid">+15</p>
            <p class="mid">-1</p>
            <p class="end">20</p>

            <p class="start">Very Large</p>
            <p class="mid">12'-20'</p>
            <p class="mid">+20</p>
            <p class="mid">-1</p>
            <p class="end">25</p>
        </div>

        <p>Harm represents how much Harm your mech can take before being broken or destroyed. A Mech will have a
            Competence and Constitution score of 0, meaning they cannot use those stats.</p>

        <p>All mechs are powered by Navidus Crystals. They will power a mech for 3 days before needing to be replaced.
        </p>

        <p class="tableTitle">Mech Size to Crystal Size</p>
        <div class="table2Col">
            <div class="colL">
                <p>Tiny</p>
                <p>Very Small</p>
                <p>Small</p>
                <p>Medium</p>
                <p>Large</p>
                <p>Very Large</p>
            </div>
            <div class="colS">
                <p>1"-2"</p>
                <p>2"-3"</p>
                <p>3"-4"</p>
                <p>4"-5"</p>
                <p>5"-6"</p>
                <p>6"-7"</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Notice that this is the same as devices, that is because devices follow the same dimensions for tiny, very
            small, small, etc.</p>

        <p>Once a Mech it takes its maximum amount of Harm, your Mech is no longer functional. Mechs cannot be healed
            through normal means. They must be repaired. A crafting check of 10 or more, with the right materials, can
            restore 2 Harm from the Mech. If a Mechs power source is damaged, it explodes violently.</p>

        <p>You can add as many limbs and devices to your Mech as you deem necessary. However, if you are trying to add
            devices to your Mech that wouldn’t normally exist, you must go through a separate invention process for each
            device that wouldn’t normally exist.</p>

        <p>If your creature is built for combat, its damage bonus will be however much its weapon would normally do as
            well as its Tough score. So, if you have a Large Mech that is wielding a heavy weapon, it will have a +17
            Bonus in total (+2 for the heavy weapon and +15 for the Tough stat of the Mech).</p>

        <p>The Mech does not add its Tough score if the weapon being used is a ranged weapon such as a bow or gun. The
            standard damage bonus is applied.</p>

        <p>You can control you mech either by creating a cock pit where you control it from inside the Mech or through
            some invented controller.</p>

        <h2>Prosthetics</h2>
        <p>With the invent skill, you can create artificial limbs. You’ll need to go through the invention process if
            prosthetics wouldn’t normally exist. Then you can simply attach it to the injured creature. However, it will
            be similar to a peg leg when it comes to mobility and original functionality. But you can insert various
            gadgets and devices into a prosthetic for functionality, convenience, and to easily hide them.</p>
