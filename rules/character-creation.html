        <h1>Character Creation</h1>
        <p>Your character is a persona you take on as you play the game. This is the protagonist that will be making
            decisions and affecting the world around you. To begin making a character, you’ll need a printed character
            sheet and a pencil. Keep in mind that you will act as this character throughout the duration of the game.
        </p>

        <div class="csDownloadContainer">

                    src="/images/download-solid.svg" alt="" class="filter" /></a>
        </div>

        <h2 id="whoAreYou">Who are You?</h2>
        <p>At the top-right of your character sheet are 4 fields: name, race, physique, and demeanor.</p>

        <p><strong>Name</strong> is your character’s name. All people need a name. This is what other players will refer
            to you as during the game. It can be anything, but make sure it sounds epic. Like Bob. Bob is always a great
            name for a character.</p>

        <p><strong>Race</strong> is your character’s race. In this game, six unique races for you to choose from: Locess, Mausca, Orcs, Sentari, Slated, and Ungal. A list of these races with descriptions is further down.</p>

        <p><strong>Demeanor</strong> is how your character holds them self in most situations. Write in an adjective like cocky, excitable, confident, etc. This adjective is a tool to help you act as your character would. </p>

        <p><strong>Physique</strong> is how your character is built physically. Write in an adjective like fat, thin, lean, strong, etc. This adjective is a tool to help the Game Master know what Non-Player Characters in the world would see at a glance.</p>

        <p>You can put the bottom four fields together, to create a brief description for you character. For example: A fat, jovial Mausca named Bob.</p>

        <h2>The Races</h2>
        <p>When selecting or creating a race, your stats will be decided. Your stats are three terms located at the top-right of your character sheet: Nimble, Tough, and Competence.</p>

        <p><strong>Nimble</strong> defines how much physical finesse your character has. Nimble is used to move quickly, jump over objects, dodge, and other actions that require more finesse.</p>

        <p><strong>Tough</strong> defines how much physical strength your character has. Tough is used to lift and move heavy objects, wrestle other creatures, and other actions that require more strength.</p>

        <p><strong>Competence</strong> defines your ability to act under pressure and read situations. It is used to instinctually understand situations and see things that other people wouldn’t. In moments of pressure and crisis, it will be used.</p>

        <p>Beside each term is a row of bubbles that mark how much of that stat your character has. The more bubbles filled in, the better you will be when you try to do something related to that task (see the <a href="./skills.html"><em>Skills chapter</em></a> for details). When you pick a race, you are given a modifier next to each stat. Fill in the bubbles on your character sheet to match the modifiers given.</p>

        <h2>Who where You?</h2>
        <p>All characters need a past that defines them. This will help you understand how your character would act in the game. On the back of the character sheet are four large boxes labeled Goals & Motives, Personal Morals, Flaws & Weaknesses, and Important Connections.</p>

        <p>These four boxes are what defines how your character behaves. In each box, jot down one or two brief sentences that you want for your character. If you can’t think of anything right away, that’s okay. You can slowly fill these out during play. As situations arise, try to decide why your character would do what you want them to do. Then see if that reason would fall under one of these four categories. If it does, then jot down a quick note so you remember in the future.</p>

        <p>Try to keep these somewhat general. Trying to be too specific can make it much harder to find things to put here.</p>

        <p><strong>Goals & Motives</strong> are what drives your character. Perhaps they want to be the greatest thief that ever lived, or perhaps their family is motivating them to go out and make some money to send back to them. Perhaps they’re seeking revenge on someone, or they want to open up a small business and settle down. The world is your oyster here and anything you think of can work. </p>

        <p><strong>Personal Morals</strong> are your character’s personal code of ethics. Perhaps they are completely against all violence. Or maybe they think killing a person they don’t know is completely okay. Maybe their okay with stealing, or maybe they’re very rigid about following the law. </p>

        <p><strong>Flaws & Weaknesses</strong> are the things that your character struggles with. Perhaps they’re a kleptomaniac (impulsively steals things), or maybe they’re terrified of fire. Perhaps they will always do what an attractive person wants them to do, or they’re easily distracted.</p>

        <p><strong>Important Connections</strong> are connections from your past. These can be tutors, trainers, parents, professors, criminal contacts, and other important connections your character could have made in their past. This is primarily useful for the Game Master so that they can tie connections from the past into the game.</p>

        <p>Once you’ve got some things put in each box, consider writing out a full backstory if you’re feeling ambitious. This is where you describe their life and what they’ve gone through up to the point when the game starts. This is where you can give specific reasons for what you put in those 4 boxes.</p>

        <p>From here, you need to give your character some skills. On the skills chart, fill in four skills up to the +0 mark. If you’ve made a backstory, try to consider what skills would make sense for your backstory. If you haven’t made a backstory, feel free to pick whatever skills you think would work for your character.</p>

        <p><em>Do not start with the myth skill before reading through the <a href="./myth.html">Myth chapter</a></em></p>

        <p>Finally, you need to select a wealth adjective. This describes how wealthy your character is on average. If you wrote a back story, go with whatever makes the most sense for your back story. If not, you should probably go with Moderate.</p>

        <p class="tableTitle">Wealth Adjectives</p>
        <div class="table1Col wealthTable">
            <p>Destitute</p>
            <p>Poor</p>
            <p>Moderare</p>
            <p>Wealthy</p>
            <p class="lastItem">Exquisite</p>
        </div>

        <p>Pick an adjective and fill in the corresponding bubble in the Wealth box.</p>

        <p>While you’re on your adventure, you may end up buying more items than your character generally carries around. When this happens, your Wealth may go down. More details on this in <a href="./the-market.html"><em>The Market chapter</em></a>.</p>

        <p>After that, you will need to determine how lucky your character is. Roll 1d6 (1, 6-sided die) and consult the table. Fill in the corresponding bubble in the Luck box on your character sheet.</p>

        <p class="tableTitle">Luck</p>
        <div class="table2Col luckTable">
            <div class="col1">
                <p>1</p>
                <p>2</p>
                <p>3</p>
                <p>4</p>
                <p>5</p>
                <p class="lastItem">6</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col2">
                <p>-3</p>
                <p>-2</p>
                <p>-1</p>
                <p>+1</p>
                <p>+2</p>
                <p class="lastItem">+3</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Whenever you do something or want something to happen that would rely on luck, you will roll 2d6 (2, 6-sided dice) and add the number that is in your luck box. The higher the total number, the better the outcome.</p>

        <p>This same principle is how skills work (see the <a href="./skills.html"><em>Skills chapter</em></a> for details).</p>

        <h2>Where are You Going?</h2>
        <p>This final part of character creation should be done with all players present, because this decision will affect everyone.</p>

        <p>You now need to decide where your character is going. You and everyone else in your party are joining a guild, and from here the grand adventures the Game Master has in store for you will begin. There are six common guilds, each will train your players in a specific set of skills.</p>

        <p>Once you choose a guild, all players will increase the skills listed to +1.</p>

        <h3>Assassins Guild</h3>
        <p>Assassins are those that believe anyone is worthy of death… for the right price. Assassins lurk in the dark and strike when least expected. They are efficient killers and know how to get in, spill blood, and get out as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p class="tableTitle">Guild Skills</p>
        <div class="raceStat">
            <p><em>Investigate</em></p>
            <p><em>Sneaky</em></p>
            <p><em>Social</em></p>
            <p><em>Throwdown</em></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mythic Hunters Guild</h3>
        <p>Mythic Hunters are those that thrill in hunting the most dangerous beasts of the wilds. Their main goal is to kill Mythic creatures, harvest Navidus Crystals from them, and bring the crystals back to the guild. Occasionally, they will get hired to kill Mythic creatures that are causing a nuisance, or to help defend smaller towns from Mythic creature attacks.</p>
        <p class="tableTitle">Guild Skills</p>
        <div class="raceStat">
            <p><em>Investigate</em></p>
            <p><em>Medic</em></p>
            <p><em>Nature</em></p>
            <p><em>Throwdown</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Explorers Guild</h3>
        <p>Explorers desire to bring the unknown world into the light. They go beyond the borders of the map to discover lands that no race has ever experienced. They know that the wonders of the world are beyond the borders of current maps.</p>
        <p class="tableTitle">Guild Skills</p>
        <div class="raceStat">
            <p><em>Craft</em></p>
            <p><em>Investigate</em></p>
            <p><em>Medic</em></p>
            <p><em>Throwdown</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Mercenaries Guild</h3>
        <p>Mercenaries are those who use their strength to make a profit. They are loyal defenders – if they get paid. They are masters of martial skills and make formidable opponents.</p>
        <p class="tableTitle">Guild Skills</p>
        <div class="raceStat">
            <p><em>Craft</em></p>
            <p><em>Investigate</em></p>
            <p><em>Medic</em></p>
            <p><em>Throwdown</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Thieves Guild</h3>
        <p>Thieves understand the concept of value. They know that a fortune can only be made when working outside the law. Nothing is beyond their grasp and no place is prohibited to them – if they can be sneaky enough.</p>
        <p class="tableTitle">Guild Skills</p>
        <div class="raceStat">
            <p><em>Investigate</em></p>
            <p><em>Performace</em></p>
            <p><em>Sneaky</em></p>
            <p><em>Throwdown</em></p>
        </div>

        <h2>Going Forward</h2>
        <p>Now that you have a character, give your character whatever items make sense due to your skills, background, and guild. Next, go on to the next chapter to learn about skills, what they are, what they can do, and how to increase them.</p>

        <p>We suggest you read the rest of the book in its entirety as well to get a good grasp of the game and its mechanics. It’s not necessary but it might be good to see what can be accomplished.</p>

        <p>There’s so much you can do with the mechanics we’ve created for you, and we think you’ll really enjoy using them. And if you don’t care about the mechanics but want some good world lore to read, go through the Mythos in the Appendices of the book.</p>

        <p>As you move forward through the game, we hope that you find a love for roleplay and enjoy the systems of the game as much as we do.</p>

        <p><em>Good luck!</em></p>
