        <h1>Myth</h1>
        <p>Magic in Guildsmen is not conventional. In this game magic comes from a drug known as Myth – a liquid that is created by refining the blood of Mythical creatures – and it is highly addictive. It is administered by syringe and can be deadly for both the user and those around them.</p>

        <h2>The First Dose</h2>
        <p>Upon first injecting yourself, you immediately get a taste of its seductive power. For the very first injection your character makes, you must raise your addiction level to the 1 mark on the addiction meter. This only happens on the very first injection your character ever does. If you chose the myth skill as a starting skill, you must start the game with level 1 addiction to Myth.</p>

        <h2>Myth Addiction</h2>
        <p>If your addiction meter is filled up to at least the 1 mark, then you are addicted to Myth and whenever you make a dice check of any kind, you’re need for more Myth grows. Starting from the right side of the addiction meter, fill in a bubble beneath the addiction meter every time you make a dice roll. Once the bubbles reach your addiction level, your need is at its strongest and you <em>must</em> have more Myth.</p>

        <p>If you inject Myth into yourself at or before this time, your need is reset. If your need reaches your addiction level, and you do not inject more Myth into yourself, then you take Harm equal to your addiction level. This can be halved with a Constitution stat check of 10 or more. Once the Harm is taken, your addiction goes down by one bar, your need is reset, and you begin filling it in again.</p>

        <p>This means that the more addicted you are to Myth, the more often your need will arise and the harder it will be to survive the rehabilitation process if you want to stop using Myth.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Myth must be used. If you finish filling in need bubbles and you have any Myth uses left, then you take Harm, and the magic becomes restless. You must make a magic skill check of 10 or more to control it, otherwise the magic explodes out form you dealing Harm equal to 2 times the number of uses you have left to you and everything within 10 feet.</strong></em></p>

        <h2>Myth Quality</h2>
        <p>Each vial of Myth gives you a number of uses to manipulate an element depending on its quality. </p>

        <p class="tableTitle">Quality to Uses</p>
        <div class="table2Col">
            <div class="colL">
                <p>Crude</p>
                <p>Average</p>
                <p>Good</p>
                <p class="lastItem">Excelent</p>
            </div>
            <div class="colS">
                <p>1</p>
                <p>2</p>
                <p>3</p>
                <p class="lastItem">4</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>You can inject yourself with more than one vial of Myth to increase the number of spells you can cast before needing to inject again, but that can be dangerous.</p>

        <p>Every time you inject yourself with Myth, you immediately fill bars on the addiction meter equal to the number of uses the Myth gives you. So, if you injected yourself with some average Myth, you would fill in 2 bars on the addiction meter in the Magic Addiction box on the character sheet.</p>

        <p>Each vial of Myth contains one type of Myth that gives you specific powers. Generally, it gives you power to manipulate a specific element. Mixing Myth types is deadly. If you inject two types of Myth into yourself or inject a vial of two types of Myth that have been combined, you immediately take Harm equal to the number of uses that the vial would’ve given. This effect can be halved with a successful Constitution stat check of 10 or more.</p>

        <p>After that, the power is wild and unwieldy. It must be used right away. If you make any skill checks other than myth skill checks while two type of Myth flow through you, you must make a myth skill check of 12 or more to see if you can control the power. Otherwise, you lose control of the power the Myth gave you and raw power explodes outward from you dealing Harm equal to the number of uses you have left multiplied by 3 to you and everything around you within 10 feet.</p>

        <p>So, if you were was to inject yourself with good quality Myth that was actually two types of Myth combined, you would need to immediately roll a Constitution stat check. Lets say you only roll a 9. However, needed a 10 or more, so you would take 3 Harm because a good quality Myth give 3 uses. Then, let's say that you attempt to hold that power in and go do something else, like persuade a guard that, “no officer, I was not just doing drugs”. You would then roll a <em>myth</em>> skill check. Say you only roll a 5 but need a 12. The magic in your viens would explode out from you dealing 9 Harm (3 multiplied by all 3 uses since you never used any of it) to you and everything within 10 feet of you, because you never used the magic, leaving you and the guard dead.</p>

        <p><strong><em>If you ever attempt to hold more than 6 uses of Myth at once, you will die. Your fragile body gets overloaded with power, and you explode, dealing 18 Harm to everything within 15 feet.</em></strong></p>

        <h2>Myth Types</h2>
        <p>Air Myth</p>

        <p>Fire Myth</p>

        <p>Lightning Myth</p>

        <p>Metal Myth</p>

        <p>Stone Myth</p>

        <p>Water Myth</p>

        <h2>Using Myth</h2>
        <p>Once injected, you have a number of uses that can be used to manipulate the element of your Myth. To manipulate the element, you simply roll a <em>myth</em> skill. The Game Master will decide how difficult the skill check will be based on the effect you’re trying to achieve.</p>

        <p>For example: trying to cause sparks or make a candle flame sway in a specific way would be very easy but trying to spontaneously cause your opponent to combust or redirect a wildfire would be very difficult.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Whenever you successfully use Myth to manipulate an element, you will become more addicted to the Myth. On a successful use, you must fill in 2 bars on the addiction meter on your character sheet.</em></strong></p>
