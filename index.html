    <h1>Welcome to Guildsmen!</h1>
    <h2>This Game</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Guildsmen! A steampunk-esque, pen and paper, roleplaying game. Here, you will create a character and
      interact with the fantastic world of Thelius. This game is a “theater of the mind” experience where one player
      (known as the Game Master) will create an adventure that the other players will play through as if they are the
      protagonists in the story. All you’ll need to play this game is this book, some pencils, some character sheets,
      and
      some 6-sided dice.</p>

    <p><em>If you’ve never played a table-top roleplay game before, you’re in for a treat! </em></p>

    <p>A table-top roleplay game (TTRPG) is an interactive adventure that is narrated like an audio book. But instead of
      just one narrator, every player in the group helps narrate the story and make the decisions of the main
      characters.
    </p>

    <h3>The Players</h3>
    <p>As a player, you are the protagonist of a great adventure! You will be given a story to go through where you can
      explore places, talk with people, discover secrets, and become the hero. How this story plays out is completely up
      to you. You make the decisions, and the Guild Master narratively describes the results of your actions.</p>

    <p>This is a story that you are writing with each of the other players. The end is not set, and your actions
      determine
      everything in this world – and you can do anything! Be it start a business, kill a dragon, overthrow the monarchy,
      or explore the wilderness.</p>

    <p>This book is full of mechanics that will help determine the outcome of your actions.</p>

    <h3>The Game Master</h3>
    <p>As the Game Master, you are the great storyteller. You weave the players, places, and people together to create
      memorable adventures. It is your job to narrate the story and judge the outcome of the players’ actions.</p>

    <p>You will create a story and guide your players through it.</p>

    <h2>The World</h2>
    <p>The world of Guildsmen is known as Thelius. This is a world of many races, many gods, and much magic. However,
      the
      story you weave can take place in any world you want. But there are a few rules that must remain constant in order
      for the rules in this book to work.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Mythic creatures exist and have hearts of Navidus Crystals (see the Invention chapter for details).</li>
      <li>The world is steampunk, but Navidus Crystals are also used to power devices.</li>
      <li>Guilds are common establishments throughout the world.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Beyond these 3 simple rules, the time era and world you set your game in is completely up to you. If you don’t
      know
      where to start, feel free to use the world of Thelius as your world of play.</p>

    <h2>Using This Website</h2>
    <p>This website is separated into 3 pages: Rules, Lore, and Bestiary. Rules outline all the core rules of the TTRPG
      and is organized into chapters. Lore is where all the information for the world of Thelius is. Thelius is the core
      world of Guildsmen. Bestiary is where you go to learn about all the fantastic creatures we have to offer. Your
      next step from here should be to go to the Rules page.</p>

    <p>The first part of the rules outlines how to build a character. This part is for all the players. Then, we will
      explain how the game works and what mechanics are at the players disposal. If you are the GM, you need to read
      through all of the rules so that you can guide your players through the game. Players only need to read the
      Character Creation and Skills chapters as well as whatever seems relevant to their character.</p>

    <p>At the end of the rules is a chapter titled <em>For the Game Master</em>. This chapter teaches you how to govern
      the game as well as how to create your own stories.</p>

    <p>So now, go to the rules page and get ready to enter <em>the world of Guildsmen!</em></p>
