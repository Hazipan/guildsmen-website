      <p class="description">Crocodiles are medium creatures that grow up to 15ft wide and can weigh up to 2,300lbs.
        They are generally territorial and solitary creatures, lurking in rivers or lakes. They hunt from underneath the
        water and attack from underneath with incredibly powerful jaws. They will also drag their victim under the water
        to drown them if the initial attack doesn't kill.</p>

      <div class="actions">
        <p class="actionHead">Actions</p>

        <p><strong>Chomp</strong> (+5) - The Crocodile chomps down with its jaws that are powerful enough to crush a
          person's body.</p>

        <p><strong>Drowning Drag</strong> - <em>(Requires that a body of water is nearby.)</em>The Crocodile grabs you
          and drags you into the water. It grapples you via an
          opposed Tough check. If the crocodile succeeds, then you take 3 Harm and are then dragged into the water to
          cause 1 Harm (ignoring armor) for every round that you are held under the water. </p>
