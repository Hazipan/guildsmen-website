      <p class="description">The Police Captain is the head of the Police Officers. They are not someone to be taken
        lightly. They are far more aggressive about pursuing wrong-doers and enforcing the law than their subordinates
        would be.</p>

        <p class="actionHead">Actions</p>

        <p><strong>Light Pistol</strong> (+3) - The Police Captain fires at you with their pistol.</p>

          quarters.</p>

        <p><strong>Shock Rod</strong> (+3) - A light, melee weapon that most Police Captains carry. It causes intense

          to be <a href="/rules/comba.htmlt#conditions">Stunned</a> for 10 seconds (1 combat round). This can be used on
          conductive surfaces to stun for 10 seconds and deal 3 Harm to anything touching the conductive surface.</p>

        <p><strong>Bola</strong> - The Police Captain throws a bola at their victim. If successful, the victim becomes
          <a href="/rules/combat.html#conditions">Entangled</a> for 20 seconds (2 combat rounds).
