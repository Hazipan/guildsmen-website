      <p class="description">Police Officers take their duty seriously. They protect the citizens and do their best to
        keep ruffians and thugs off the streets and maintain the peace. However, a few have been known to turn a blind

        <p class="actionHead">Actions</p>

        <p><strong>Light Pistol</strong> (+3) - The Police Officer fires at you with their pistol.</p>

        <p><strong>Light Sword</strong> (+1) - The Police Officer slices with their sword when combat gets into close
          quarters.</p>

        <p><strong>Shock Rod</strong> (+3) - A light, melee weapon that most Police Officers carry. It causes intense
          electrical damage upon a successful hit, but drains a 1” Navidus Crystal. It also causes any affected creature
          to be <a href="/rules/combat.html#conditions">Stunned</a> for 10 seconds (1 combat round). This can be used on
          conductive surfaces to stun for 10 seconds and deal 3 Harm to anything touching the conductive surface.</p>

        <p><strong>Caltrops</strong> - The Police Officer lays a set of caltrops on the ground. Any soft footed
          creatures that walk through them must roll a Nimble check 10+ or get knocked down and take 1 Harm.</p>
