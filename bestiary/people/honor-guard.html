      <p class="description">An Honor Guard protects the highest of nobility and other political figures. They are
        aggressive and severe with anyone that looks even remotely like they might cause trouble. They take their duties
        very seriously and they have been trained extensively in combat. Their honor is everything to them and all their
        honor lies in their duty to protect the person theyâ€™ve been sworn to protect.</p>
