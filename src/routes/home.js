            <h1>Welcome to Guildsmen!</h1>
            <h2>This Game</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Guildsmen! A steampunk, fantasy-esque, pen and paper, table-top roleplaying game. Here, you will
                create a character and interact with the fantastic world of Thelius. This game is a “theater of the mind”
                experience where one player (known as the Game Master) will create an adventure that the other players will play through as if they are the protagonists in the story. All you’ll need to play this game is this book, some  pencils, some character sheets, and some 6-sided dice.</p>

            <p><em>If you’ve never played a table-top roleplay game before, you’re in for a treat! </em></p>

            <p>A table-top roleplay game (TTRPG) is an interactive adventure that is guided by you and those you play with. But instead of. Every player in the group helps narrate the story and make the decisions of the main characters.
            </p>

            <h3>The Players</h3>
            <p>As a player, you are the protagonist of a great adventure! You will be given a story to go through where you can explore places, talk with people, discover secrets, and become the hero. How this story plays out is completely up to you. You make the decisions, and the Guild Master narratively describes the results of your actions.</p>

            <p>This is a story that you are writing with each of the other players. The end is not set, and your actions
                determine everything in this world – and you can do anything! Be it start a business, invent the bicycle, kill a dragon, overthrow the government, or explore the wilderness.</p>

            <p>This book is full of mechanics that will help determine the outcome of your actions.</p>

            <h3>The Game Master</h3>
            <p>As the Game Master, you are the great storyteller. You weave the players, places, and people together to create memorable adventures. It is your job to narrate the story and judge the outcome of the players’ actions.</p>

            <p>You will create a story and guide your players through it.</p>

            <h2>The World</h2>
            <p>The world of Guildsmen is known as Thelius. This is a world of many races, wild places, and great invention. However, the story you weave can take place in any world you want. But there are a few rules that must remain constant in order for the rules in this book to work.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Mythical creatures exist and have Navidus Crystals inside of them (see the <a href="./rules/creatures.html"><em>Creatures chapter</em></a>).</li>
                <li>The world is steampunk, but Navidus Crystals are also used to power devices (see the <a href="./rules/invention.html"><em>Invention chapter</em></a> for details).</li>
                <li>Guilds are common establishments throughout the world.</li>
                <li>Magic exists and is performed through a drug known as Myth (see the <a href="/rules/myth.html"><em>Myth chapter</em></a>).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Beyond these 4 simple rules, the time era and world you set your game in is completely up to you. If you don’t know where to start, feel free to use the <a href="/lore.html"><em>world of Thelius</em></a> as your world of play.</p>

            <h2>Using This Website</h2>
            <p>This website is separated into 5 pages: Rules, Lore, Bestiary, Resources, and Community. <a href="/rules.html"><em>Rules</em></a> outlines all the core rules of the TTRPG and is organized into chapters. <a href="/lore.html"><em>Lore</em></a> is where all the information for the world of Thelius is. Thelius is the core world of Guildsmen. <a href="/bestiary.html"><em>Bestiary</em></a> is where you go to learn about all the fantastic creatures we have to offer. <a href="/resources.html"><em>Resources</em></a> is where you can find all the resources of the game for download, such as the character sheet and a quick reference guide. <a href="/community.html"><em>Community</em></a> has links to all our social areas and information on contributing to this game.</p>

            <p>Your next step from here should be to go to the Rules page.</p>

            <p>The first part of the rules outlines how to build a character. This part is for all the players. Then, we will explain how the game works and what mechanics are at the players disposal. If you are the Game Master, you need to read through all of the rules so that you can guide your players through the game. Players only need to read the Character Creation and Skills chapters as well as whatever seems relevant to their character.</p>

            <p>At the end of the rules is a chapter titled <a href="/rules/for-the-gm.html"><em>For the Game Master</em></a>. This chapter teaches you how to govern the game as well as how to create your own stories.</p>

            <p>So now, go to the rules section and enter <em>the world of Guildsmen!</em></p>
